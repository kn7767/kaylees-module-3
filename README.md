Module 3 - make a random password generator 

## Descriptioin 
Creating a customizable random password generator tests how well I understand JavaScript and my ability to gather information on the internet to better understand the concepts that build the generator. 

## Usage
This site is designed to generate a random password. It allows users to customize what characters (numbers, symbols, upper and lowercase letters) they do and do not want included in their password, as well as choosing how many charactors.
